If you got Staapl from the darcs archive or a tarball snapshot, install using:

        make

This links the project into your user PLT collects directory so the
(require zwizwa/staapl/...) forms will work, and byte-compiles the
sources.

To install somewhere else use this as root:

        bin/install <collects-dir>
