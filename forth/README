FORTH language
--------------

An extension to the SCAT language to support Forth-like syntax
(parsing words). This is combined with the MACRO language to create
PURRR, but the idea is to keep it separate from the MACRO postponed
semantics to be able to represent Forth-like syntax on top of
scheme. The forth/lang folder implements a Forth layer on top of SCAT.
