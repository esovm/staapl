#lang racket/base

;; Cleaned up version of a partial evaluator / concatenative language.

;; ROADMAP:

;;  * Port the pattern matching syntax to 1stack operation. This
;;    should be quite straightforward, only 'pattern-tx->macro'
;;    changes.
;;
;;  * Get the primitive macros to work (compile, literal)
;;
;;  * Split the current macro/ language into clean Coma and dirty
;;    Control macros.
