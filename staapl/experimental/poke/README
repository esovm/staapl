POKE
----

A language on top of MACRO, either with flat Forth syntax, or
s-expression Joy-like syntax.

The main idea is to explore C code generation, and a minimal VM to run
real-time linear code. Target is 16/32-bit embedded systems and DSP.

The result of a "require" statement should be compilable C code.
