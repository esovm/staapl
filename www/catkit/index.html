CATkit, a PCB designed in collaboration with GOTO10 and the
Huddersfield University Centre of Excellence in Digital Design.

This is the first iteration towards a standard platform for teaching
Staapl/Forth based embedded application development for PIC18.
However, it has some bootstrapping problems that introduce a
dependency on PIC programmer hardware and a specific (expensive) USB
serial cable that prevent its effective use as an essentially
zero-cost platform.  I am looking into ways to solve this in a second
iteration.

The schematics are available <a href="http://zwizwa.be/archive/sheep-schem.ps.gz">here</a>. 
This circuit is supported by the <a href="../sheep">Sheep</a> software.

The PCB layout is freely available upon request.  The board hardware
is no longer for sale.  In return for feedback or collaboration on the
Staapl project, I can send you one of the remaining kits as a trade.
