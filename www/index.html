<h1>Staapl</h1>


<h2>TL;DR</h2>

Staapl is a "macro assembler on steroids" for PIC18 microcontrollers.
It can be used for writing firmware optimized for size.  It goes where
C can't go, and where assembler would be too complicated.  It is based
on Scheme (code generator) and Forth (target language / machine
model).

<h2>About</h2>

<p> Staapl uses custom code generators (macros, partial evaluation,
  metaprogramming, staging, ...) to generate code that is severely
  resource-constrained.  

<p> Staapl is an extension of
  the <a href="http://racket-lang.org">Racket</a> programming
  language, a Scheme dialect with strong support for embedded domain
  specific languages (EDSL) written in terms of Scheme macros.  A
  Staapl target language is a collection of target code generator
  macros.

<p> The language for the
  Microchip <a href="http://www.microchip.com/PIC18/">PIC18</a> is a
  language based on
  on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_programming_language">Forth</a>.
  It has an optimizing peephole compiler, and a tethering mechanism
  with interactive console for running-target code updates through the
  PicKit2 programmer.

<p> Unlike traditional Forth which is highly reflective, Staapl is
  built
  using <a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/plt/publications/macromod.pdf">macros
  with phase separation</a>, which breaks the circular reflection into
  a directed language tower, creating a static semantics (the meaning
  of the language doesn't change inside one module, in contrast with
  original Forth's approach).  Most of Staapl is organized around a
  convenient abstract syntax based on a
  typical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concatenative_programming_language">
  concatenative</a> combinator language
  like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy_(programming_language)">Joy</a>.
  This syntax can then be used as a base for different interpretations
  or as a target for concrete syntax frontends.

<p> (With the risk of being too vague..) While the PIC18 language is a
  stack language, the basic code generator structure could support any
  kind of "algebraic" language
  (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_programming">point-free</a>
  languages without variable bindings).  Note that "point-free" only
  refers to the basic compoisition mechanism.  The core substrate of
  Staapl is still Scheme, so primitive macros can have local variables
  if that simplifies programming.  This is used effectively in the
  Staapl Forth for PIC18.

<p> The basic idea is that point-free languages are easily manipulated
  on the meta-level which makes them an ideal code generation target.
  1. Such languages have no variables that complicate code generation
  due to scope issues (hygiene).  2. Thanks to the associativity of
  the operations of concatenation (syntactically) and function
  composition (semantically), computations are trivially partitioned
  in compile time and run time.  3. Reliance on combinators for
  program structure (as opposed to explicit recursion and loops)
  allows for the derivation of program transformation laws that can be
  used for program derivation or compilation to efficient
  implementations.


<h2>Status</h2> 

<p>
  The phase I goal - a usable system for PIC18, be it with some rough
  edges - is reached, and the corresponding code is put in incremental
  improvement mode. 

<p> This base will serve as the basis for phase II: further
  experiments with point-free domain specific languages for
  DSP/control, static verification, and more elaborate compilation
  techniques to implement them.

<p> At this time, Staapl is only practical for the PIC18 architecture.
  While writing other ports should be straightforward, it is a lot of
  work.  I have some code for the 12 and 14 bit PIC cores, and I've
  been looking into porting staapl to PIC24/30/33 (dsPIC).  The main
  hurdle is writing a peephole optimizer for the new architecture.


<h2>Documentation</h2>

Documentation is loosely split into two parts: one that documents the
whole system from a Scheme p.o.v. and one that exposes only the
low-level Forth language view.

( NOTE: Some of this is a bit outdated.  If you're interested and
having trouble getting things running, I'd be glad to help out in
return for some feedback.  Send me an email. )

<p>Since this is a developer-oriented project with a lot of effort put
  into clean organization, I suggest looking at the source code to
  pierce through the top-layer of workflow glue. Staapl is structured
  as a library with multiple entry points, not a monolithic
  application. I encourage you to build your own workflow on top of
  it, and integrate it with other tools. (And share that code!).


<h2>Hire Me</h2>

<p>Staapl is best fit for producing turnkey burn-and-forget binary
firmware blobs, with no constraints on tools for team-integration.
The basic idea is that I can be cheap as long as you don't need to
modify the code yourself.  Not that you can't or that I'm reluctant to
provide source code and build tools, but there's a steep learning
curve involved.  ( Powerful tools do take some investment. )

<h2>Projects</h2>

<p>
  The PIC18 Forth language has been used in:
  <ul>
    <li> An interactive Forth console for the PicKit2 programmer.
    <li> The <a href="sheep/">Sheep</a> sound synthesizer.
    <li> The <a href="forthtv">ForthTV</a> B/W composite video
    generator.
    <li>
      The <a href="catkit/">CATkit</a>
      and <a href="krikit/">KRIkit</a> boards.
    <li> Several hands-on workshops.
  </ul>

<h2>Download</h2>

<p>Staapl is part of PLaneT. To install the command line Forth
  compiler frontend,
  install <a href="http://download.plt-scheme.org/">PLT Scheme 4.1</a>
  or newer (only MzScheme is required) and type this with
  administrator privileges:
<pre>
  raco pkg install github://github.com/zwizwa/staapl/master
</pre>
This will install the <code>staaplc</code> wrapper application
alongside <code>mzscheme</code>. All Scheme modules are accessible
using standard PLaneT paths.

<p>For the latest changes track
the <a href="http://zwizwa.be/darcs/staapl">darcs</a> archive (hashed
darcs-2 format).  If you need a snapshot that doesn't depend on darcs,
just ask.  The Staapl source code, including that of its subprojects,
is released to the public under the terms of the GPL v2. Staapl is
written by Tom Schouten.
